/// This macro allows you to create a simple wayland environment handler.
///
/// It will define a struct which upon creation communicates with the server
/// to fetch the list of global objects and instanciate them with the newest
/// interface version supported by both the server and the client library.
///
/// This struct comes with a static constructor `init(display)`, which takes
/// a display, and returns the created struct and an `EventIterator` associated
/// with the display and all the global objects.
///
/// Note that none of the events associated with the newly created objects are
/// dispatched (expect for the registry), allowing you to change the event iterators
/// associated with them before dispatching them, if you want to.
///
/// The struct has these public fields:
///
/// - `display`: the `WlDisplay` provided as argument
/// - `registry`: a instance of the `WlRegistry` associated
/// - `globals`: a `Vec` containing the globals advertized by the server, in the format
///   `(global_id, interface_name, version)`
///   Note here that `version` is the version advertized by the server.
/// - One field for each of the objects you specified, of type `Option<T, u32>`, in the format
///   `(proxy, version)`. The value is `None` if this global was not advertized by the server.
///
/// Note that:
///
/// - If you specify several objects of the same interface, only the first one will be
///   populated.
/// - If a global is advertized several times (like `wl_seat` or `wl_output` can be), only
///   the first one will be automatically bound (but all will still be listed in the `globals`
///   list).
///
/// The struct also provides two methods:
///
/// - `fn rebind<T: Proxy>(&self) -> Option<(T, u32)>` which will try to bind once more a global
///   (this allows you to effectively clone a global, and is perfectly legal). It will match
///   the first global of that type that was encountered. Returns `None` if this global type was
///   not encountered.
/// - `fn rebind_id<T: Proxy>(&self, id: u32) -> Option<(T, u32)>` which will try to bind once
///   more a global with given id as listed in `globals`. Returns `None` if given id is not known
///   or if its interface does not match with the provided type.
///
/// Example of use:
///
/// ```no_run
